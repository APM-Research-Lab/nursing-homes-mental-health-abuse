## This script is used to identify the CMS ID numbers for facilities that have specific oversight related to caring for people with SMI in nursing homes. We will be removing these facilities from our census dataset for most of our analyses, because we want to focus on those "regular" nursing homes that are under no particular special regulations. 

## The nursing homes in each state that are in some way under some specific oversight for SMI care were identified by contacting the health department or similar agency in each state. We did not get a response from all states. The summary of those responses is available here (should work with @mpr.org email addresses): https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invcSaVwX3PaXNEoh&inviteToken=a82d8e0ff843b99fd4eb2c3d3fdab20670b12f1d9a4d899944d0195d93a1d643
